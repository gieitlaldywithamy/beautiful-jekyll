title: The Imp of the Perverse
subtitle:  Laying it bare 
---
I was on holiday last week. Unfortunately, my holiday and relationship were soured by my actions. On Sunday, as I sat on
a Megabus in jeans stained by my own faeces, I decided that my 'Imp of the Perverse' was not going to win today.

I met my boyfriend later that day who is no longer living with me and is no longer sure if he wants to be with me because of
how I have been behaving. He suggested that I seek out counselling and so I called the GP this morning.

Today, I was given a preliminary diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder by my GP. Getting off my chair the waiting room
took time and a lot of deep breaths. So will finding ways not to stop destroying my relationships, romantic and platonic, 
hurting myself and in short, self-sabotage. But I will do it. I'm already doing it. 

The Imp of the Perverse can go fuck itself. If it won't behave cordially with me, it can fuck off.
