Life in the digital age is a high-voltage affair. 
For many of us, our eyes and brains are overstimulated and often, including myself, exist on a tightrope over burnout. Personally, I struggle with anxiety and self-confidence issues and on my journey to improve my mental wellbeing, I wanted to share with you one of ways I help improve it.

It's walking!
Walking is one of the most simplest pleasures of all. Me and my boyfriend have a lovely tradition of taking his dog Clover out for a walk, sometimes around Holyrood Park next door to where his family lives or further afield such as North Queensferry.
I love spending quality time with my boyfriend like this, it's become a tradition for us. One that I treasure.

Interestingly, 'Shinrin-yoku', or 'forest bathing' is a short, leisurely trip to a forest and is a recognised stress management technique popular in Japan.

So fancy a 'Shinrin-yoku'?
