When a novel opens with a young adult being stopped by Police at Dover with 113g of pot and an urn full of ashes in whilst having some sort of nervous breakdown, immediately you know this is going to be a very well spent couple of evenings.

Similar to Kurt Vonnegut, Existence exposes us to the action at the end of the story and then brings the 
reader back to the beginnning of the story to see how the events leading up to the final action have 
impacted our narrator, Alex. On the surface, 'The Universe Versus Alex Woods' is a coming of age novel 
about a naive, quirky misfit teen whose live is shaped by fantastically improbable events. At the age of 10, he is hit on the head 
by a 2.3 kilogram meteorite travelling at 200 miles an hour  which leads to Alex developing epilepsy. Forced to stay off school until his fits can be controlled by a combination 
of medication and medication, he consequently misses out on a large portion of secondary school and spends his days reading, helping 
out in his clairvoyent mother's crystal shop and emailing a meteor expert.

The most significant improbable event which happens to Alex is meeting Mr Peterson, an elderly reclusive Vietnam War veteran. Alex had taken
refuge from bullies in Mr Peterson's greenhouse, who wrongly presumes Alex is up to no good.  As penance, Alex has 
to carry out errands for Mr Peterson and the pair develop an unlikely companionship over their 
shared love for classical music and Kurt Vonnegut. Mr. Peterson has his own problems, 
and since the death of his wife he wants nothing to do with the outside world.

Alex and Mr Peterson's friendship heartening frienship is the central theme of the novel and one of the many things I loved about this novel. Their friendship is is the same vein as that in Rita and Frank in 'Educating Rita' (one of my favourite plays)
and it develops organically and is not in any way sentimental or tokenistic which I credit Cline for. The writings of Kurt Vonnegut provide a framework for the pair
to discuss heavy subjects such as atheism, free will, humanism and politics.
When the novel darkens towards the end, Extence skillfully keeps the narrative engaging and deals with a difficult, shadowy topic with emotional sincerity.
Black humour and Mr Peterson's characterisation, a welcome antidote to endless depictions of wise old men, makes this novel hugely enjoyable and had me laughing out loud.

Refreshingly, Alex's adolescent awakening is more death than sex. For Alex, growing up means facing the laws of physics. (I'm going to leave you to find out why yourself).
The Universe versus Alex Wood is a ruddy brilliant novel and I would highly recommend you pick it.
