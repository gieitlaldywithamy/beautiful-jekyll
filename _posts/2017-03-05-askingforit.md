In her small home town in Ireland, our 18 year-old narrator Emma O'Donovan is Queen Bee. She's beautiful, popular and has has her whole life ahead of her. By the end of Asking For it, however, she just wants to fade away: “My body doesn’t belong to me any more … I want to erase it.” This is because she has been brutally gang-raped and subsequently, when she goes public, subjected to a horrific campaign of vilification and humiliation by her community and the world.

Split into two parts - before and after the assault -upon reading the first half you could easily mistaken the novel as another run of the mill, teen cliché novel. However, this normalcy acts as juxtaposition with the depression, pain and fear that come later. It makes the events in this books relevant, showing how they could happen to anyone.

O’Neill takes the brave step of making Emma a unlikeable character. She is constantly making sure that boys notice her, and if they don’t, she wonders why. She is jealous of her friends, hates people who don’t make an effort with their looks, and seeks to be centre of attention. She also advises her friend Jamie to remain silent after she is raped: “Let’s just pretend it didn’t happen,” I told her. “It’s easier that way. Easier for you.” Emma doesn’t follow our preconcieved views of how a victim behaves before and reacts afters. This challenges the reader, by forcing them to almost think that Emma was asking for it. Following, the reader questions their own subconscious bliefs. By O’Neill forcing the reader to dislike the main character, she is able to undermine the defence of ‘they were asking for it’ and shame victim blaming. There is no dictionary entry for a rape victim - rape can happen to people of all ages, backgrounds and appearances. 

While Emma has no memory of the disgusting assault, forgetting is not an option in her goldfish social-media world. Photos are published online and go viral on twitter. The church turn on Emma and support her attackers. The second half uses a lot of repetition which highlights how monotous Emma’s life has become. There is no fairytale ending.

Although the issue of consent is at the novel’s core, O’Neill resists passing judgment. Instead she forces the reader to consider the morality. Was she “asking for it”? That’s what everyone wants to know about the attack on Emma. But the real point is: why do we live in a society where such a question is permitted at all? 

Asking For it is an uncomfortable read. Firstly because of its contents, but secondly because of its wider focus, tackling rape culture and what rape survivors can experience, socially and legally. We need a huge cultural shift in how we see rape. The only way this will happen is with the issue of consent becoming a topic of conversation, especially with young people.
